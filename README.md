<h1 align="center">Hello world! I'm Alice Rose 👋</h1>
<p>
  I’m a software engineer with almost two decades of professional experience building products for the web and an emphasis on accessibility, performance, and security.
</p>

On the side, right now I’m:
- 🔐 learning more about security
- 🧪 experimenting with [Astro](https://astro.build)
- 🔌 trying out hardware programming
- 💾 playing with [Risc OS](https://www.riscosopen.org/content/) (the operating system of my first computer!)
